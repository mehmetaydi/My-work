During my work at Tampere University, I did most of the work on the analysis of brain signals. I have studied on the behavior of the brain signals received from the scalp of the patient for different modes of the exoskeleton device that supports the patient's walking. Besides that, I developed some algorithms to reduce artifacts that are coming from the heart and muscles. moreover, I classified brain signals according to the exoskeleton mode  with ML-based methods on brain signals.

- The readiness potential (RP), a slow buildup of electrical potential recorded at the scalp using electroencephalography, has been associated with neural activity
involved in movement preparation. This [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811919308778) explains pretty good what RP is. Acouple of images from my work is as below. The first image shows
