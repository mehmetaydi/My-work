- This MATLAB_files  contains two different files about how to detect bubbles in image and how to extract images from a taken video

The purpose of this research is to determine a technique for elongating bubbles and solidifying the foam structure in a 2D system. To do this, we will see what is the impact of particles, heat and flow on the foam. This advance will create an anisotropic structure whose mechanical properties will depend on the directions of stress.

# Bubbles detection

In this section the number of bubbles in an image, how the velocity of bubbles react while the temperature of the hot plate, where bubbles swim, changing, the accentricity of bubbles depending on different temperatures and the distriubtion of areas(film areas and empty areas in image) have been proposed.

# Number of frames

This tiny script is used for extracting images from a video by adjusting the number of images per second
