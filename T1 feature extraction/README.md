This subfolder contains scripts I wrote with my colleagues during my work at Aalto University. The topic is about the experimental determination of the bubble size coalescence and particle motion in foams created in gas-liquid flow with surfactants and Extracting Features  Causing T1 events in Foams with advanced Machine Learning Techniques. We have written two papers about this topic.
